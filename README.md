after various failed attempts to make keyframes work to my liking in my first blender-script work I request your help ðŸ¥²

So I am working on a Dataviz:

I load Data into Blender and create an object.
Then I transform the object according to the data.
Now I have 4 different years, Year1 - Year4. I want to show each transformation, for each Year with keyframes (one keyframe shows one year location, scale transformation)
and all of the keyframes of the 150 country-Objects should start and end at the same time.
...But the mechanics of the for-loop are laughing at my face - I got everything working except for the keyframes which drives me mad ðŸ¤ª so If I use an offset the transformations for each object are working perfectly, but they don't start at the same time - if I try and use iteration, I have neat keyframes, but no animation (I will only show Year4). How do I get out of this Mess? ðŸ˜“
